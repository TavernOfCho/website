# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Documentation of React](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html)
  * [Documentation of Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
  * [Our issue](https://github.com/TavernOfCho/website/issues) to know what we have to do.
  * An idea, Bugs? Create a [new issue](https://github.com/TavernOfCho/website/issues/new/choose).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/TavernOfCho/website/compare) with a clear list of what you've done. 
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine, should look like this:

    $ git commit -m " YourAction #TagOfTheIssue | The Detail "

Example :

    $ git commit -m "  Resolve #87 | Add contributing guide  "

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. 

Thanks !
